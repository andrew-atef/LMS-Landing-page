## Description

Developed a fully responsive, single-page portfolio website for an English language tutor ([Teacher's Name] - e.g., Ahmed Ali) operating in Egypt. The site serves as a professional online presence, effectively showcasing the teacher's profile, qualifications, teaching methodology, and range of services (including General English, IELTS/TOEFL Preparation, Conversation Practice, Business English, etc.).

Key features include:

*   **Clear Service Presentation:** Dedicated sections detailing the different courses offered.
*   **Social Proof:** A prominent testimonials section featuring positive feedback from past students.
*   **Process Explanation:** A step-by-step guide ("How It Works") outlining the student journey from consultation to progress tracking.
*   **Information Accessibility:** Pricing options display, an FAQ accordion to address common queries, and clear contact information.
*   **User Experience:** A clean UI built with Bootstrap 5, custom CSS for branding, JavaScript-powered interactivity (like the mobile menu, potential popups), and full Right-to-Left (RTL) support for seamless Arabic language display.
*   **Lead Generation:** Integrated contact form (requires a backend handler like PHP for actual email submission) and direct WhatsApp contact details.

The project focuses on providing a static yet informative and engaging platform for the teacher to connect with prospective students.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **(Optional)** To make the contact form functional, configure a backend script (e.g., `your_form_handler.php`) on a web server and update the `<form>` action attribute in `index.html`.

## Customization

*   **Content:** Replace all placeholder text (like `[اسم المعلم/ة]`, `[رقم الواتساب الخاص بك]`, example testimonials, course details, FAQ answers, etc.) with the actual teacher's information.
*   **Branding:** Update the logo (currently set as the teacher's name text), favicon (`assets/images/teacher_fav.png`), and potentially the color scheme in the CSS files (`style.css`, `teacher-style.css`, `rtl-style.css`).
*   **Images:** Replace placeholder images (like `assets/images/banner/teacher_photo_placeholder.jpg`, `assets/images/cta/teacher_cta_image.jpg`) with high-quality photos of the teacher or relevant graphics.
*   **Contact Form:** Ensure the `action` attribute in the contact form points to a working backend endpoint if email submission is required.
*   **Social Links:** Update the placeholder URLs (`#`, `https://linkedin.com/in/example`, etc.) in the footer and mobile menu with the teacher's actual social media profile links.
